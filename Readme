# ReadMe for 2023 work

Neural Network and Deep Learning practice using Tensorflow 2.0 and Tensorboard.
1. Upload the MNIST dataset and split 80/20 for training and testing.
2. Trained the model to bring accuracy from 10% to 98%.
3. Evaluated to ensure accuracy, and visualized the model in Tensorboard.
